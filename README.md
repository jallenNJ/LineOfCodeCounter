# LineOfCodeCounter
# Introduction
This is a simple and quick Line of Code Counter written to find the amount of lines of code written in by category of Preprocessor, Multi Line Comments, Single Line Comments, Whitespace, Code, and Total Lines. The file can scan any flat directory to get all lines in there. The program has defines at the top of the file to change what delimiter it uses for different languages, by default it is configured for C/C++

# Installation and Usage
 Run the file in a python3 interpreter
 Usage: counter.py [-h] [-o <filename>] [-v | -q] <file or Directory>
 -h for help
 -o The name of the output file
 -v Verbose outputs
 -q quiet, minimal outputs
 <file or Directory> to scan for lines of code
 
 # Future updates
 If this script is updated, the features would be to include all child directories, and native defines for common languages
